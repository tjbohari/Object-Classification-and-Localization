# Object-Classification-and-Localization
This repositorycontains code for classification of images and localizing the object in an image. We try to find highly correlated neurons through technique of average pooling layer. After getting the highly corrrelated neurons, we try to find if we can find the neurons which causes the convolutional layer to classify them into particular category.
